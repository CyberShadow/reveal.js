Notes:

- Who I am
  - "Hello"
  - "Thank you for coming"
  - "My name is Vladimir, and I have been using D since 2006"
  - "I've also contributed a few things here and there"
- People ask me "Why D? Why do you like this language so much "
  - I'll try to answer one aspect of that in this talk
- Scott Meyers' previous talk was titled "Things that matter"
  - However, I haven't done anything terribly exciting last year, so
  - "I'm going to talk about a few random **personal projects** I did over the past few years where D's metaprogramming"
